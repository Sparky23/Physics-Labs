    "We took a spring and added mass to the end of the spring. The mass was recorderd by 50 grams. Then we extended the spring with the mass at its end and let it go to allow it to oscillate. In order to record the time of each oscillation, we took a stopwatch and recorded the time it would take for the spring to oscillate four times. We then divided that time by four in order to attain the average time of each oscillation. We repeated this five times for each weight added to the spring and took the average of the five values in order to receive a more accurate estimate of the time. "
