    "Building: To build my pendulum I used a hard ceramic-like rectangle as my base. I took two twelve inch wooden planks from my moms closet. I inserted one plank in the center of the base and the other plank was placed horizontally on top of the first plank. I drilled a nail into the second plank and left space for the object to be between the nail and the plank.\n",
    "Testing: I will test my pendulum several times. Each will be to measure my pendulum for a period one one oscillation. I will use my phone as a stopwatch and record the time. I will then take the average of all my measurements."
